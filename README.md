Olympics Analytical Dashboard
This project aimed to analyze Olympic Games data, offering insights into athlete performance, medal distribution, and demographic trends across participating countries.

Data Source(s):
The data was extracted from extensive Olympic datasets containing details on athletes, medals, and country participation. I used Power BI’s Query Editor for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

Process:
Data Preparation: I used Power BI’s Query Editor to clean and prepare the raw dataset.
Analysis: DAX expressions were used to calculate key values such as total medal counts, top athlete performances, and gender distributions.
Data Modeling: I structured the data through modeling techniques, making it easier to generate accurate, insightful visualizations.
Visualization: I created a series of charts, tables, and graphs to display the findings in a user-friendly dashboard format.


Challenges & Solutions:
Managing the complex dataset and ensuring accurate analysis across dimensions like country, gender, and sport was challenging. I addressed this by using DAX to calculate key metrics and applied data modeling techniques to maintain accuracy and clarity in the dashboard.
